`So we had met our rivals at last! For the first time in history tank was encountering tank!

Frank Mitchell (First published in Everyman at War 1930)
Turn two - 24 April, Day
After breaking through the BEF trenches the Germans
pushed on towards their objectives, and captured the town
of Villers-Bretonneux and part of D’Arquenne Wood.
Following the loss of Villers-Bretonneux, General Rawlins
took measures to stop the offensive and recapture lost
ground. Local counterattacks were ordered, but the 8th
Division had been badly mauled and was unable to take
offensive measures. Two companies of tanks were present
and were ordered to engage the German units. No 1 section
of A Company had one male and two female Mark IV tanks.
It was dispatched to the Cachy switch line. There, for the
first time on the field of battle, tanks from opposing forces
met when the British tanks encountered “Nixe” of Abteilung
III under the command of 2nd Lt. Wilhelm Biltz. The two
female tanks (armed only with machine-guns) suffered
damage and were forced to withdraw. But the male tank
under the command of Lieutenant Frank Mitchell then
hit the German tank three times. The German tank was
immobilised and the crew of eighteen attempted to escape
while Mitchell’s tank continued to fire at them, killing nine
crew members. The British tank then faced two more A7Vs
and German infantry, but the German tanks withdrew
after the Mark IV had fired several ranging shots. After
the German tanks retreated, seven Whippet tanks from X
company arrived. These attacked the German infantry in
the open, causing heavy casualties. They were then attacked
by German artillery and three were destroyed. Elsewhere
the German attack began to falter. General Foch ordered
Rawlinson to recapture Villers-Bretonneux and the 13th
and 15th AIF Brigades that were in reserve were ordered
to attack. General Glasgow commander of the 13th AIF
Brigade refused to attack during daylight hours commenting
that:
“If it was God Almighty who gave the order, we couldn’t do
it in daylight. Here is all your artillery out of action and the
enemy with all his guns in position.”
The counter-attack was postponed until after dark.`,
